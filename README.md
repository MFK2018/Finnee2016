# News
## @23/11/2017
In preparation for the submission of a new manuscript, I am now updating the wiki. After many changes and optimisation, I am now happy with the first part of the Finnee toolbox. While the new version will still evolve, it is now "stable".
## @18/07/2017
The new version of Finnee differs from the previous one. I did not have the time to modify the wiki, but the quickstart_2 document will guide you through the first steps. I will update the wiki as fast as I can.
